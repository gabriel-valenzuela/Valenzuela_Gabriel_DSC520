# Distrubition of Toy Manufacturers in the Amazon Marketplace 

## Statistics in R

### Objective

For this project, I wanted to understand the current state of the toy marketplace within Amazon in its online market that includes not only toys but numerous types of products. At this time in our society, retails stores are slowly disappearing or at least retail stores that primarily focus on supplying toys due to Amazon allowing the ease of having these items delivered to our doors and offering a wide selection of products. With the stores closing, manufacturers are no longer looking at these locations to distribute these products. Now, they can almost cut out the middleman and use Amazon to distribute their products and market them to potential customers.

### Environment

R was applied within R Studio to complete the analysis

### Data Set Source

Kaggle.com

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

```r

# Removing uncessary columns
keeps <- c("product_name", "manufacturer", "price", "number_available_in_stock", "average_review_rating", 
           "amazon_category_and_sub_category","number_of_reviews")
needed_market <- marketplace[keeps]

# Clean price variable by removing extra characters and blanks then switched to numeric
needed_market$price <- gsub("^.{0,2}","",needed_market$price)
needed_market <- needed_market[!(needed_market$price==""),]
needed_market$price <- substr(needed_market$price,1,6)
# Extra Character cases
needed_market$price[1555] <- substr(needed_market$price[1555],1,4)
needed_market$price[2730] <- substr(needed_market$price[2730],1,4)
needed_market$price[2816] <- substr(needed_market$price[2816],1,4)

needed_market$price <- as.numeric(needed_market$price)

needed_market <- needed_market[!is.na((needed_market$price)),]

# Clean the avaiable toys varaiable by removing characters and replace empty values with a zero then switched to numeric
needed_market$number_available_in_stock <- stringr::str_remove_all(needed_market$number_available_in_stock,"Ã‚ new")
needed_market$number_available_in_stock <- sub("^$","0",needed_market$number_available_in_stock)
needed_market$number_available_in_stock <- as.numeric(needed_market$number_available_in_stock)

# Clean the review rating variable by removing extra characteres and replace empty values with a zero then switched to numeric
needed_market$average_review_rating <- stringr::str_remove_all(needed_market$average_review_rating," out of 5 stars")
needed_market$average_review_rating <- sub("^$","0",needed_market$average_review_rating)
needed_market$average_review_rating <- as.numeric(needed_market$average_review_rating)

# Clean the the number of reviews by replace empty values with a zero then switched to numeric
needed_market$number_of_reviews <- sub("^$","0",needed_market$number_of_reviews)
needed_market$number_of_reviews <- as.numeric(needed_market$number_of_reviews)

# Change product name variable from vector to characters
needed_market$product_name <- as.character(needed_market$product_name)


# Change manufacturer variable from vector to characters
#needed_market$manufacturer <- sub(" ","",needed_market$manufacturer)
needed_market$manufacturer <- as.character(needed_market$manufacturer)
needed_market$manufacturer <- stringr::str_remove_all(needed_market$manufacturer,"The")
```


### Analysis

When it came to this process, the first goal was to observe a summary of the market, correlation between attributes such as review rating of certain toys and price of toys, a simple scatter plot to further review any relationships. 

```r
# Summar of the cleaned market
summary(needed_market)

# Pearson Correlation Tests
cor.test(needed_market$number_available_in_stock, needed_market$average_review_rating, method = "pearson")

cor.test(needed_market$number_available_in_stock, needed_market$price, method = "pearson")

cor.test(needed_market$price, needed_market$average_review_rating, method = "pearson")

# Prices of Toys and Reviews
plot(needed_market$average_review_rating, needed_market$price, main = "Ratings VS. Price", 
     xlab = "Average Rating",ylab = "Price of Toys")

#Available Toys and Price
plot(needed_market$number_available_in_stock, needed_market$price, main = "Available VS. Price", 
     xlab = "Products Available",ylab = "Price of Toys")

#Available Toys and Rating
plot(needed_market$number_available_in_stock, needed_market$average_review_rating, main = "Ratings VS. Available", 
     xlab = "Products Available",ylab = "Average Rating")
```

Since the market is mostly supplied by the major manufacturers, I used visualizations such as a word cloud, association with the word 'toy', and barplots to see the top manaufactuerers at the time. 

```r
#### Top Manufaturers ####

# Word Cloud 
text <- needed_market$manufacturer
docs <- tm::Corpus(tm::VectorSource(text))

dtm <- tm::TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
matrix <- as.matrix(dtm)
words <- sort(rowSums(matrix),decreasing = TRUE)
df <- data.frame(word = names(words),freq=words)

set.seed(1234)

wordcloud2::wordcloud2(df, size = 0.3, shape='star')


# Word "toy" association 
tm::findAssocs(dtm, terms = "toy",corlimit=0.0)

# Top 10 Manufacturers
topManufacturers <- df[1:10,]$word
topManufacturers[] <- lapply(topManufacturers, as.character)

barplot(df[1:10,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = df[1:10,]$word,
        col ="lightblue", main ="Top Manufacturer Names Frequencies", xlab = "Words",
        ylab = "Word frequencies")

library(dplyr)
number_manufacturers <- plyr::count(needed_market, "manufacturer") %>% arrange(desc(freq))
top10_manufacturers <- number_manufacturers$manufacturer[1:10]


top10_market <- needed_market[needed_market$manufacturer == c("Oxford Diecast","LEGO","Disney","Playmobil",
                                                              " Puppet Company","MyTinyWorld","Star Wars","Mattel",
                                                              "Hasbro","Corgi"),]

#Top 10 Manufacturers and the mean prices of their products

top10_market %>%
        dplyr::group_by(manufacturer) %>%
        dplyr::summarise(price=mean(price))


ggplot2::ggplot(top10_market,ggplot2::aes(x=average_review_rating,y=number_of_reviews,fill = average_review_rating)) +
        ggplot2::geom_bar(position = "dodge",stat="identity") + 
        ggplot2::ggtitle("Manufacturer Ratings") +
        ggplot2::facet_wrap(~manufacturer) +
        ggplot2::theme_classic() +
        ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none") +
        ggplot2::xlab("")
```

Even though the manufactures dominated the market, it is possible that certain toys could stand out if they were not from these companies. Therefore, I sought to find the top toys in how often they are offered as well as how much they are associated with actual word, 'toy' when they are searched by a possbile customer. 

```r
# Top Toys
text_toy <- needed_market$product_name
docs_toy <- tm::Corpus(tm::VectorSource(text_toy))
toSpace <- tm::content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy, toSpace, "/")
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy, toSpace, "@")
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy, toSpace, "\\|")
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy, tm::content_transformer(tolower))
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy, tm::removeNumbers)
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy, tm::removeWords, c("the", "and","with","for")) 
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy,tm::removePunctuation)
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy,tm::stripWhitespace)
docs_toy <- tm::tm_map(docs_toy,tm::removeWords,tm::stopwords("english"))
dtm_toy <- tm::TermDocumentMatrix(docs_toy)
matrix_toy <- as.matrix(dtm_toy)
words_toy <- sort(rowSums(matrix_toy),decreasing = TRUE)
df_toy <- data.frame(word = names(words_toy),freq=words_toy)


tm::findAssocs(dtm_toy, terms = "toy",corlimit=0.10)

head(df_toy,10)

barplot(df_toy[1:10,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = df_toy[1:10,]$word,
        col ="orange", main ="Top Toy Names Frequencies",xlab = "Words",
        ylab = "Word frequencies")


df_toy$word <- as.character(df_toy$word)
```
